# HEARTHSOUNDS

A **react.js** bootstrapped web-based game inspired from **HEARTHSTONEÂ®**, where players need to guess cards correctly to gain points by listening to the audio of the cards from the game in a given amount of time.

### The game itself can be accessed [here](http://tepsite.xyz/hearthsounds)

###### my first ever react.js project!
